This is a part of Udacity iOS, a quiz in which we learn how to implement NSUserDefaults for persistence less than 1 MB.

The idea is to save a certain slider value (Float) into the NSUSerDefaults.standardUserDefaults(). Implementation are done in AppDelegate and the PlaySoundsViewController. The earlier to check whether a saved Float value has existed (and if not set it to 0.0), and the latter to change the saved Float value everytime the slider value is moved.
